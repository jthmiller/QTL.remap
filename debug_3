### Plotting QTL results
#### rQTL2
plot.scan1 - plot genome scan results
plot_scan1 - same as plot.scan1
xpos_scan1 - determine the x-axis location of a particular genomic position in a genome scan plot (for adding annotations)
add_threshold - Add horizontal line at a significance threshold to a genome scan plot.
plot.scan1coef - plot QTL effects along a chromosome
plot_coef - same as plot.scan1coef
plot_coefCC - like plot_coef but assuming there are 8 effects and using the standard colors for the Collaborative Cross (CCcolors)
plot_snpasso - plot SNP association results
plot_genes - plot locations of a set of genes
plot_peaks - plot a summary of QTL positions for multiple phenotypes, using the results of find_peaks
plot_pxg - plot phenotype versus QTL genotypes




### Place two pops on single map
interp_map - Use interpolate to convert from one map to another
